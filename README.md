# Mountain Travels By Shariul

## About

Mountain travels is a course work for Advanced developer bootcamp.<br/>
Layout is done by CSS Flexbox and many advanced CSS features such as Animation, shadow etc. was used. It is single page design. For icons Linea icon font is used. This website is responsive supporting devices with variety of screen sizes. With 7-1 folder architecture and BEM class naming this project becomes more versatile.<br/>
Each line of code is written by me in my own way. This project is nothing like what was in the course except for the design.
